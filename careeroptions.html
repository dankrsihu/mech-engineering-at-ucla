	<h1> What careers does a degree in Mechanical Engineering offer?</h1>
	<img src="mech-eng.jpg" alt="Mechanical"style="width:500px;height:300px;"class="center">


	<p>Mechanical engineering is a very broad degree that can lead to distinct careers, of course, 
	all within the branches of engineering.There are by no means a restriction of the careers someone can
 	pursue with such degree, As a matter of fact, because the skills and knowledge that Mechanical
 	Engineers acquire, the possibilities are limitless.
	</p>

	<h2> Possible Careers</h2>

	<h3> Mechanical Engineering</h3>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
	<li>For example, a degree in Mechanical Engineering brings the option of becoming a Mechanical 
	engineer, where it may be obvious but with this title, mechanical engineers <q>specialize in 
	developing, designing and perfecting mechanical devices</q>(Best Master&#8217;s). They work to <q>design 
	power-producing machines such as electric generators, internal combustion engines, and steam 
	and gas turbines, as well as power-using machines such as refrigeration and air-conditioning
	systems</q>(BLS). This can open doors up in the Aerospace Industry, Oil and Gas Industry, and 
	many more.
	</li>

	<h4> Industrial Engineering</h4>
	
	<li>The second available option is an Industrial Engineer. With this title, the primary goal
	is to <q>maximize efficiency</q>(Best Master&#8217;s). They use their <q>mathematical and mechanical
	engineering expertise to solve problems that arise in production or manufacturing of products</q>
	(Best Master&#8217;s). Some possible localities for this application of knowledge would be in transportation
	or even healthcare. If engineering in healthcare, engineers <q>use scientific engineering methodology
 	to create solutions to complex health care problems and improve the quality of life</q>(Mayo).

	<h5> Automotive Engineering</h5>
	
	<li>Thirdly, is Automotive Engineering. This careers yields to engineers with a particular
	interest in developing car parts, safety technologies, fuel efficient engines or anything
	else along those lines of innovation, according to The Best Master&#8217;s Degree page. 
	Automotive Engineering can lead to working with OEM( Original Equipment Manufacturer)
	automotive company.

	<h6> Biomedical/Biotechnology Engineer</h6>
	
	<li>Another career possibility with a mechanical engineering degree is that of Biomedical
	Engineer/Biotechnology Engineer. This field combines both the healthcare aspect as well
	as the engineering aspect as a hybrid to create <q>methods to construct new medical devices, 
	software or related technologies for use in the healthcare sector</q>(Best Master&#8217;s).

	<p id ="hvac"> HVAC Engineer </p>
	
	<li>A Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) Engineer is always an option as well.
	They are <q>concerned with both the air quality and the temperature in environments where their
	products are in use</q>(Best Master&#8217;s).Their work is emphasized on improving available technologies
	in heating, ventilation, air conditioning and / or refrigeration systems, as stated in Best 
	Master&#8217;s webpage.
