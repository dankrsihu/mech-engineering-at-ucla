      style="width:400px;height:250px;margin-right:30px;">This study is dedicated to improving the functionality of artificial hands and their use in human-machine systems.
      Some examples of what the Biomechatronics Lab studies:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Neuromuscular control of multiple digits during manipulation tasks</li>
    <li>Tactile sensor technology that can provide rich tactile feedback for use in real-time control of artificial fingertips</li>
    <li>Machine-learning algorithms that will enable the mapping of tactile sensor signals to features of finger-object interactions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Some applications of this include a prosthetic arm, a wheelchair-mounted robot hand and arm for increasing the independence of wheelchair
    users, and a semi-autonomous, teleoperated manipulators for handling of dangerous devices or high consequence materials</p>

  style="width:300px;height:150px;margin-right:30px;">This labâ€™s goal is to develop experimental and computational tools that can be used in conjunction with data-driven machine learning methods to design, model,
  and build smart programmable structures. They do this by taking two approaches:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Numerical: fast and efficient numerical simulation tools that serve as the source of data for machine learning algorithms</li>
  <li>Experimental: collaborative robots that semi-autonomously perform experiments to gather data</li>
  </ul>

      style="width:300px;height:150px;margin-right:30px;">The Bionics Lab has primary research fields of medical robotics and biorobotics including surgical robotics, and wearable robotics.
      Some of the research include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Wearable Robotics: Robotic systems that are worn by the human operator as an orthotic devices and
        used as a human-amplifier, assistive device, haptic device, or for automatic physiotherapy and rehabilitation.</li>
      <li>Surgical Robotics: Robotic devices enabling the surgeon to learn and perform minimally invasive and open surgery safely and effectively.
        collaborative robots that semi-autonomously perform experiments to gather data</li>
      </ul>
