	<h2><center> What is Engineering?</center></h2>

<p> Engineering is the ability to apply knowledge and solve multifaceted problems that affect society in order to increase efficiency or innovation. Therefore, representing a crucial component to daily life . Very simple tasks performed on a daily basis such as checking your cell phone, getting your garage door to open, turning your car on, walking onto the 7th floor on a building, broadcasting the weather for the following days, and many more are made available because of the work of engineers. Without engineering, humanity would still be in caves. For one simple reason students should consider pursuing a career in engineering: help humanity step into the future with technological innovation. This is the digital age, so why not pursue this field while it is on the rise.
