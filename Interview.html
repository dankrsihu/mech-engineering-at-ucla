<h1>Interview With an Engineer</h1>
<p>In order to find out what it is actually like to be a mechanical engineer at UCLA, I sat down with Caleb Lessard-Clouston, a fourth year mechanical engineerings student and teaching assistant for Engineering 96A and 96R.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>Okay, so today is October Twenty-Fourth. My name Ricardo Esquivel and I am here with,</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Caleb Lessard-Clouston.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>Okay Caleb. So I understand you are a fourth-year mechanical engineering student.</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>That is correct.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p> Okay. I'm just start off with a simple question here. Why did you choose mechanical engineering as your major?</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>So in high school, I decided that, first of all, I really enjoyed math that was a big part of it. But I wanted to solve problems. I knew that much. I wanted to solve hard problems, not sales problems or business problems. I wanted to solve technical math problems. That's what I wanted to do. But I wanted to do it where they're like applications. I chose Mechanical engineering because I thought that about that seemed kind of like the hardest. I guess, and that appealed to me. And then also it's the closest to like engineering 50 years ago.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p> So when you enter UCLA, you knew from the start mechanical engineering was going to be your major.</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Yeah, so I started as mechanical and was pretty confident. I considered switching to aerospace, briefly, but at the end of the day, mechanical is aerospace. In terms of a major it's a few classes different.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>Okay, what was your exposure to Mechanical Engineering before coming to UCLA?</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Pretty limited. I think like most pretty Limited. I just knew they built cars. They build machines and planes. They build big things and really small things in general.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>Would you say UCLA provides like resources to people maybe don't have quite as much exposure to engineering once you’re at UCLA?</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Definitely. the school, the administration does a pretty good job They have a speaker series, every speaker series that actually invite a couple of students and then have like an event beforehand. I got invited to one with the vice president of Uber. I just got to ask him questions and be very candid. Handshake, the platform for finding jobs, I think it is cool what they’re doing with it. But I think the best exposure comes from the clubs and other students. The best thing UCLA has done is to facilitate the connection between older students and younger students because people who are a step ahead are the best people to get advice from rather than people who are 20 steps ahead.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>So you're a fourth-year student, I assume you are familiar with mechanical engineering.</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p> Yeah, to an extent, as much as a student can.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>So what would you say are the skills you need to be a successful mechanical engineer.</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>You have to be resilient, you have to be good at looking back on your mistakes. You know, failing makes you smarter, as long as you learn from those mistakes. If you don’t look back on your mistakes, failing does nothing for you. Looking back at your mistakes is really really important, in all types of engineering.
In mechanical engineering, I think creativity plays a very interesting role. A big part of mechanical engineering is just. Design, like specifically mechanical design, it's just about figuring out ways at work. I think that there are a lot of scenarios where there are different ways you could do it. In other disciplines, you are trying to find a solution, but there is only one solution. In mechanical engineering, there are a lot of different ways to solve the same problem. So just to be a good mechanical engineer, tap into your creativity and be willing to do things without the fear of it being the wrong path. Instead, be confident that at the end of that path there will be a solution.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>For someone who knows they want to be an engineer, but doesn't know which type why would you say that they should choose mechanical engineering?</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Yeah, I think mechanical engineering is one of the largest for sure, one of the most well established. Just looking at the departments at UCLA, it’s one of the biggest, like it's way bigger than aerospace because, if you look at aerospace, it's very specific. So if you don’t know what you want to do in engineering why would you choose something very specific? Why cut yourself off? 
If you look at industry every company has mechanical engineers. Apple hires a ton of mechanical engineering because they manufacture everything. How do you do that? Mechanical engineers. I think, when deciding, it comes down to whether you like computers and how computers work, or do you like how things work. If you like how things work, mechanical engineering is a pretty good option.
To sum it up, it's like how all dolphins are whales but not all whales are dolphins. All engineering displaces, with the exception of computer science, include mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering includes all that but the other ones don’t include everything. It's like thermodynamics heat transfer all that stuff. That’s mechanical engineering. That relates to Chemistry. But if you’re doing Chemical Engineering, you’re going to specialize so much that you don’t get exposure to all the other stuff.</p>

<h3>Ricardo Esquivel</h3>
<p>Well, thank you Caleb for participating in this interview.</p>

<h3>Caleb Lessard-Clouston</h3>
<p>Yeah, no problem.</p>
