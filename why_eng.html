<td>I was first introduced to engineering in 7th grade when I did a summer engineering residential program at CSULB where I was introduced to new career 
paths that I never knew existed. In highschool I took my first computer science class my freshman year. I didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t fully understood what 
I was doing and I didn’t understand why I was writing the code. I decided to revisit computer science my junior year when I applied for a Girls Who Code 
Summer Internship. I was accepted and taught 
introductions to programming and learned about real-world applications to computer science. In retrospect, this is where I learned why 
I code. Simply put, I chose engineering, specifically computer science because I have fun doing what I do. Coding is very 
daunting at first, but it feels like I’m solving a puzzle each time I write code. I find computers fun to work with and 
learning how to program with one is a useful skill that can be applied to EVERYTHING. Look at your phone. Every machine, 
object, or computer are just lifeless cool objects until programmers and computer scientists give it a purpose and make it
move/work. This is why I chose computer science! Programming is the core to all machines and projects. 
I’m interested in what goes on behind the scenes of apps, websites, and computers. I want to know WHY things work. I want to 
continue innovating the way things are done. I want to build better programs. This is why I’m a computer science major.

<td>Mechanical Engineering</td> 
<td>At school, my passions were math and science. At home, I loved building with Legos. When I heard of mechanical engineering and saw it combined all of my favorite things, math, science, and building, I knew it was the career for me.

<td>Computer Science and Engineering</td> 
<td>I chose Engineering because I wanted to acquire the knowledge to be able to not only think outside the box, but also problem solve some of the issues society is facing today. I chose the Computer Science and Engineering major, because I enjoy the interdisciplinary aspect of learning both the programming features, and the hardware and design aspect of computer systems.

<td>Aerospace Engineering</td> 
<td>Personally, engineering was not something that I knew I was going to pursue since I was  a kid. As a matter of fact, I didn’t want to be one thing, I wanted to pursue about 4 different unrelated careers. When applying to colleges I had a conversation with my cousin who was pursuing a degree in civil engineering and he asked what major I was going to apply to schools as. I was completely split between mathematics and their different branches, but after telling him my interests in math and science, he suggested me to look into engineering. That's when it all clicked, I can combine different subjects I love and still get to apply it in real life! I looked into the branches of engineering and decided that Aerospace was the most compelling. My decision was rather spontaneous.
