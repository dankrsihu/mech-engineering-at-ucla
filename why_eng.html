<td>Mechanical Engineering</td> 
<td>At school, my passions were math and science. At home, I loved building with Legos. When I heard of mechanical engineering and saw it combined all of my favorite things, math, science, and building, I knew it was the career for me.

<td>Computer Science and Engineering</td> 
<td>I chose Engineering because I wanted to acquire the knowledge to be able to not only think outside the box, but also problem solve some of the issues society is facing today. I chose the Computer Science and Engineering major, because I enjoy the interdisciplinary aspect of learning both the programming features, and the hardware and design aspect of computer systems.

<td>Personally, engineering was not something that I knew I was going to pursue since I was  a kid. As a matter of fact, I didn’t want to be one thing, I wanted to pursue about 4 different unrelated careers. When applying to colleges I had a conversation with my cousin who was pursuing a degree in civil engineering and he asked what major I was going to apply to schools as. I was completely split between mathematics and their different branches, but after telling him my interests in math and science, he suggested me to look into engineering. That's when it all clicked, I can combine different subjects I love and still get to apply it in real life! I looked into the branches of engineering and decided that Aerospace was the most compelling. My decision was rather spontaneous.
